               Fibonacci and the Golden Ratio
              </h1>
              <p style="text-align:center">
                There is a unique ratio that can be used to describe the proportions of everything from nature's
                smallest building blocks, such as atoms, to the most advanced patterns in the universe, like the
                unimaginably large celestial bodies. Nature relies on this innate proportion to maintain balance,
                but the financial markets also seem to conform to this "golden ratio." Here, we take a look at some
                technical analysis tools that have been developed to take advantage of the pattern.
                Mathematicians, scientists, and naturalists have known about the golden ratio for centuries.
                It's derived from the Fibonacci sequence, named after its Italian founder, Leonardo Fibonacci
                (whose birth is assumed to be around 1175 A.D. and death around 1250 A.D.). In the sequence, each
                number is simply the sum of the two preceding numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.).
                But this sequence is not all that important; rather, the essential part is the quotient
                of the adjacent number that possess an amazing proportion, roughly 1.618, or its inverse 0.618.
                This proportion is known by many names: the golden ratio, the golden mean, PHI, and the divine proportion,
                among others. So, why is this number so important? Well, almost everything has dimensional properties that adhere
                to the ratio of 1.618, so it seems to have a fundamental function for the building blocks of nature.
                Don't believe it? Take honeybees, for example. If you divide the female bees by the male bees in any given hive,
                you will get 1.618. Sunflowers, which have opposing spirals of seeds, have a 1.618 ratio between the diameters of each
                rotation. This same ratio can be seen in relationships between different components throughout nature.
                Are you still having trouble believing it? Need something that's easily measured?
                Try measuring from your shoulder to your fingertips, and then divide this number by
                the length from your elbow to your fingertips. Or try measuring from your head to your feet,
                and divide that by the length from your belly button to your feet. Are the results the same?
                Somewhere in the area of 1.618? The golden ratio is seemingly unavoidable.
                But does that mean it works in finance? Actually, financial markets have the very same mathematical
                base as these natural phenomena. Below we will examine some ways in which the golden ratio can be applied
                to finance, and we'll show some charts as proof.
