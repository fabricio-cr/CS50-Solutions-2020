               Fractal
              </h1>

                In mathematics, a fractal is a self-similar subset of Euclidean space whose
                fractal dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear
                the same at different levels, as illustrated in successive magnifications of
                the Mandelbrot set. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly
                small scales called self similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding
                symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger
                sponge,[5] it is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory.

                One way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is the way in which they scale.
                Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new
                to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in).
                Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of
                the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However,
                if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a
                power that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal,
                and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.

                Analytically, fractals are usually nowhere differentiable. An infinite fractal curve
                can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line – although it is still
                1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.

                Starting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, fractals have moved through increasingly rigorous mathematical
                treatment of the concept to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century by the seminal
                work of Bernard Bolzano, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass,[8] and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th
                century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century.
                The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin frāctus,
                meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns
                in nature.

                There is some disagreement among mathematicians about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined.
                Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals."
                More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff–Besicovitch
                dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension."Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and
                expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way." Still later,
                Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use fractal dimension
                as a generic term applicable to all the variants".
