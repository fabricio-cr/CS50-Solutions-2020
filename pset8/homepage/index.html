              </h1>
              <p>Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. The word is sometimes shortened to maths (in England, Australia, and New Zealand) or math (in the United States and Canada).
              Mathematicians are people who do mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world, so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics.
              Today, some mathematics is needed in many jobs. Business, science, engineering, and construction need some knowledge of mathematics.
              Mathematicians solve problems by using logic. Mathematicians often use deduction. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths.
              To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking
              different from other kinds of thinking.
